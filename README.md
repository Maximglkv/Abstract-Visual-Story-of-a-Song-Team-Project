# Abstract-Visual-Story-of-a-Song-Team-Project

Name: Maxim Gladkov

Student Number: C22785565

Class Group: By myself


# Description of the project
Reactive objects and lines put together, inspired by the song I used, "Heaven's Door (Instrumental Sped Up Edit)" by Mqx.


# Instructions for use
When you run the code, you will have a black screen with an object in the middle, press your 'space bar' to start the song,
additionally you can pause the song at any time with another push of the 'space bar'.

If you want to restart the program, you must either wait until the song has finished or press 'escape' key to exit the program.
Pressing 'space bar' after the song has finished will play the song again.

# References
https://github.com/skooter500/GP-2020-2021, used Audio Startup to begin my audio visualizer but have adjusted as needed.

# How it works

# Top and Bottom Waves
Line shape was used, it uses a map calculation to adjust the colors, I added an additional set of lines to create an outline for the original line. 

# Sphere
Using a nested loop to calculate the longitude and latitude values, then I used a 2D array to store the vertices and add triangle strips.

# Particle Effect
Ellipse and rectangles shootout using an increment and it uses a angle formula to shootout it from the centre in a circular way, its on a loop so it repeat its increment values.


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am proud with how the sphere and waves turned out, I thought of the second layer of waves last minute for the project and thought it would be a cool feature. It ended up having an astonishing effect on the visualizer. I wish I could've done my original idea of a sphere spinning with the beat but it had been difficult, but I ended up learning a lot about how spheres are made with maths. I didn't figure out how to make it rotate but I settled for an alternative where the sphere only shows the outline of the vectors and its size would react with the music. I decided it would fit better so I am happy with it.

I was by myself for this project so I am happy with how it looks and feels. I am a perfeconist so I enjoyed adjusting each value until I felt like it conveyed the correct tone and nature of the song. This exercise has broaded my general knowledge and usage of java, I wasn't comfortable with java at the start, but this project was nice and enjoyable as I got to learn different methods for creating these visuals.
